# Automated Garden Door Opener

This project is an automated garden door opener system, designed to control the opening and closing of a garden door using an Arduino microcontroller. The system includes a motor mechanism, various electronic components, and a user-friendly interface for operation.

## Overview

The automated garden door opener system uses an Arduino board, a motor driver, and sensors to automate the movement of a garden door. The system can be controlled remotely and is designed to be energy-efficient and easy to use.

### Key Features
- **Remote Control**: Operate the garden door using a remote or smartphone app.
- **Manual Override**: Allows for manual control in case of system malfunction or preference.
- **Energy Efficient**: Optimized to minimize power consumption.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can set the speed and extent of door movement.

## Components

1. **Arduino Board**: The main controller of the system, responsible for processing inputs and controlling outputs.
2. **Motor Driver**: Manages the motor's speed and direction for opening and closing the door.
3. **Power Supply**: Powers the entire system, ensuring consistent operation.
4. **Sensors**: Detect the position and status of the door.
5. **Relay Module**: Facilitates the control of high-power devices such as motors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Arduino and electronic components.
- Required hardware components listed above.
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reza9234/automated_door.git

2. Open the `bagh1.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

### Usage

1. Assemble all hardware components according to the provided circuit diagram.
2. Connect the system to the power supply.
3. Use the remote control or smartphone app to operate the garden door.

## How It Works

The system employs an Arduino microcontroller to manage a motor connected to the garden door. Sensors monitor the door's position, and the motor driver regulates the door's movement. The user can control the system remotely or manually via a switch.
